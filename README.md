# RayTracer
For Graphics Programming 1 in the 2nd year we were introduced to a basic framework with which we had to write a Ray Tracer.

Learning the new world of 3D programming from scratch wasn't easy. I found it very mathematical at first. Seeing the very first rays getting drawn on screen was a magical experience. Every bit of progress gave you new excitement.
